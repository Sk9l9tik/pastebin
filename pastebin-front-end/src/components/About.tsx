                        <p className="pt-2.5 font-light text-[18px]">Pastebin is a website where you can store any text online for easy sharing. The website is mainly used by programmers to store pieces of sources code or configuration information, but anyone is more than welcome to paste any type of text. The idea behind the site is to make it more convenient for people to share large amounts of text online</p>

                        <p className="font-semibold text-2xl">What is My Pastebin?</p>
                        <p className="pt-2.5 font-light text-[18px]">When you create an account you get your own Pastebin. This means you can now store pastes and have full control over them at any point in the future. Having your own Pastebin is also great for sharing your pastes with others. Your Pastebin is both public and private at the same time. Your public pastes are visible to everybody while the private ones are only visible to you.</p>
